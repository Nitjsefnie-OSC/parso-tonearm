# Hermetic production-flow + visual regression harness (issue #80): `make tonearm-production-regression`.
# No Docker, network, model download, signing secrets or device. Runs the TonearmProductionRegressionTests
# target in the foreground and exits non-zero on any production-flow, adapter-call, accessibility,
# lease or baseline-render failure. Artifacts (actual render + diff) go to $TONEARM_HARNESS_ARTIFACT_DIR.
# `TONEARM_HARNESS_RECORD=1` rewrites baselines; review the git diff before committing it.
